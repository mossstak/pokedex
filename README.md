<h1 align="center">Pokedex</h1>

This is pokedex react app using a tutorial which i followed. It has taught me a lot more about React Hooks such as usestates, useEffects. It has also taught me the different between fetch data and axios which on this app it has only axios used. I would still like to make some more changes, maybe add other variables such as the evolution data like the images, different tabs of the generation for each pokemon this way, they can be easily found and has less loading time.

my application is run on vite js so if you'd like to run the application please type in your command line, <p ><strong>npm run dev</strong></p>
